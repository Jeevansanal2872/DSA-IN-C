# DSA - Clean C Programs

This repository contains cleaned, simplified and well-documented **C programs** for common Data Structures & Algorithms tasks used in college DSA labs.
The goal is **clarity, correctness, and efficiency**, while preserving the original program outputs.

## Structure

- `programs/` — all polished C source files (ready to compile).
- `PROGRAMS.md` — short, exam-friendly explanations for each program.
- `LICENSE` — MIT license.

## How to build

```bash
make all
# or compile a single program

## Notes

- I kept the program behavior identical to the originals (same input/output semantics).
- Code was simplified for readability and minor performance improvements where applicable.
- If you want line-by-line exam-style explanations inserted into each file, tell me and I'll add them to `PROGRAMS.md` or inline comments.
